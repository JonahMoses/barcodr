<h1>Barcodr</h1>
<p>What a life I live!</p>
<p>I just sit here on heroku and spin up when people need me..</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of responsibility, just a CPU intensive one (sorry if I leak memory like crazy too).</p>
<p>Here are the fancy things I'll help you with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I can whip out a barcode PDF like this; GET /barcodes/{DATA}.pdf</li>
  <li>I can whip out a barcode JPG like this; GET /barcodes/{DATA}.jpg</li>
</ol>

<p>I know what you are thinking.. that's not that fancy actually.. well.. soon I'll have more fonts.. would that be fancy?</p>
